'''Anarchism''' is an [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] [[political philosophy]]{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1p=59|2a1=Flint|2y=2009|2p=27}} that rejects [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] deemed unjust and advocates their replacement with [[Workers' self-management|self-managed]], [[Self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary, [[cooperative]] institutions. These institutions are often described as [[Stateless society|stateless societies]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sheehan|1y=2003|1p=85|2a1=Craig|2y=2005|2p=14}} although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non-hierarchical or [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].{{sfn|Suissa|2006|p=7}} Anarchism's central disagreement with other ideologies is that it holds the [[Sovereign state|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|loc=Anarchism|2a1=Craig|2y=2005|2p=14}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] of the [[political spectrum]],{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} and much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[Libertarian socialism|anti-authoritarian interpretations]] of [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], or [[participatory economics]].{{sfn|Guerin|1970|p=35|loc=Critique of authoritarian socialism}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many [[History of anarchism|anarchist types and traditions]] exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} [[Anarchist schools of thought]] can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].{{sfn|McLean|McMillan|2003|loc=Anarchism}} Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of [[Social anarchism|social]] and [[individualist anarchism]], or similar dual classifications.{{sfnm|1a1=Fowler|1y=1972|2a1=Kropotkin|2y=2002|2p=5|3a1=Ostergaard|3y=2009|3p=14|3loc=Anarchism}}

== Etymology, terminology and definition ==
{{see also|Anarchist terminology}}
The etymological origin of the word anarchism is from the ancient Greek word ''anarkhia'',  meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''a-'' (i.e. &quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (i.e. &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix [[-ism]] denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy.{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} The word anarchism appears in English from 1642{{sfn|Definition of Anarchism by Merriam-Webster|2019}} as ''anarchisme''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|anarchism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the word ''anarchy'' from 1539.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|anarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} the term [[libertarianism]] has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guerin|1970|loc=The Basic Ideas of Anarchism}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1= Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to [[Individualist anarchism|individualistic free-market philosophy]] only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as libertarian anarchism.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p= 217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organization]] (including the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Anarchism and capitalism| capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism| nationalism]] and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[voluntary association]], on [[freedom]] and on [[decentralisation]], but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an ''a posteriori'' conclusion).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}}

Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}
# The will for a non-coercive society.
# The rejection of the state apparatus.
# The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society.
# A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of [[anarchy]].

== History ==
{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Prehistoric and ancient world ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
During the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that hierarchy was invented and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} Most notable examples of anarchism in the ancient world were in [[History of China|China]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]], meaning peaceful delegitimizing of the state, was delineated by [[Taoism|Taoist philosophers]] (i.e. [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] and [[Lao Tzu]]).{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Likewise in Greece, anarchist attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and [[autonomy|personal autonomy]]. Socrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''Nomos'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''physis''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

During the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Islamic world or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In Persia, a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian Prophet]] known as [[Mazdak]] was calling for an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian society]] and the [[abolition of monarchy]], but he soon found himself executed by the king.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}} In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Those currents were the precursor of religious anarchism in the centuries to come. It was in the [[Renaissance]] and with the spread of [[Rationalism|reasoning]] and [[humanism]] through Europe that libertarian ideas emerged. Writers were outlining in their novels ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

=== Modern era ===
The turning point towards anarchism was the [[French Revolution]] in which the anti-state and federalist sentiments began to take a form, mostly by [[Enragés]] and ''[[sans-culottes]]''.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} Some prominent figures of anarchism begun developing the first anarchist currents.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} That is the era of classical anarchism that lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 and was the golden age of anarchism. [[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England morally delegitimizing the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to individualism and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxism|Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] before his expulsion by the Marxists]]
[[Mikhail Bakunin]] took mutualism and extended it to [[collectivist anarchism]]. Bakunin's current ([[Jura Federation]]) entered the class worker union called the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), later known as the First International, formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} Bakunin's followers entered a bitter dispute with Marx which ended in 1872 with the split of the workers movement that officially took place in [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} The major reason lay in fundamentally different approaches on how the workers would emancipate themselves. Marx was advocating for the creation of a political party to take part in electoral struggles whereas Bakunin thought that the whole set of Marx's thinking was very authoritarian.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=24–25}} Bakunin is famous for predicting that if such a party would gain power by Marxist's terms, it would end up to be the new tyrant of workers. After being expelled from the IWA, anarchists formed the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and distribution of goods according to one needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}} The major argument of anarcho-communism was that Bakunian perspective would lead to antagonism among collectives.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At the turning of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, pouring into Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In [[Latin America]], [[Anarchism in Argentina|São Paulo]] was a stronghold and anarcho-syndicalism was the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During that time, a minority of anarchists embarked into utilizing of violence in order to achieve their political ends. This kind of strategy is called [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, anarchists were persecuted and given bad fame.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} [[Illegalism]], stealing the possessions of the rich because capitalists were not their rightful owners, was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during those same years.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]]. During the revolution, anarchists had concerns, but they opted to support the revolution instead of the [[White movement|Whites]]. However, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilized. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious [[Bolsheviks]]. Anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow instead fled to Ukraine.{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} The [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]'s struggle in the [[Free Territory]] were the most notable examples. With the anarchists being crashed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. Platformists sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. The victory of the Bolsheviks in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]] did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw the Bolshevik success as setting an example and [[Communist party|communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) left the organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}

In the [[Spanish Civil War]], anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. Spain had a long [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist tradition]] and anarchists played an important role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named [[May Days]] as [[Joseph Stalin]] tried to seize control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

=== Post-World War II era ===
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|[[Rojava]] is supporting efforts for workers to form cooperatives, such as this sewing cooperative]]
In the first years after World War II, the anarchist movement was severely damaged.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism. The main causes of such a revival may have been the perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and the tension build by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this era, anarchism was mostly part of other movements critical to both the state and capitalism such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Peace movement|pacifist movements]], the [[New Left]], or the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi &amp; 539}} Anarchism was also associated with the [[punk rock]] movement as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} Although [[feminist]] tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]] in the 1960s.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}}

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the [[anti-war]], [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[Group of Eight]] (G8) and the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF). Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]] and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. These actions were precipitated by ''ad hoc'', leaderless, anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s—other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity group]]s and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Chiapas, Mexico, and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern [[Syria]].{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

== Anarchist schools of thought ==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
{{libertarianism sidebar}}
[[Anarchist schools of thought]] had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions ([[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]]) which have some different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc= Anarchism|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc= Anarchism}} The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]] (opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual) while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, &quot;recognising equality of entitlement&quot;.{{sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools—those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]] which the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2006|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [[Minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate and usually temporary, necessary evil, but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.{{sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist- and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.{{sfn|Esenwein|1989|p=135}} The various anarchist schools of thought or currents are not distinct entities, but intermingle with each other.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=1–6}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the primary proponent of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|anarcho-mutualism]] and influenced many future [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchist]] thinkers]]
[[Collectivist anarchism|Collectivist]] and [[Anarcho-communism|communist]] anarchism and [[anarcho-syndicalism]] are all considered to be forms of [[social anarchism]]. [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]] were the other notable anarchist currents through the 19th and early 20th century. Social anarchism rejects [[Private property#Criticism|private property]], seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]) and emphasises [[cooperation]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].{{sfn|Ostergaard|1991|p=21}}

==== Mutualism ====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.{{sfn|Wilburn|2019|pp=213–218}} Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;{{sfn|Graham|2015|loc=Chapter One: Anarchism before the International}} and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Copleston|1y=2003|1p=69|2a1=Supek|2y=1975|2p=94|2ps=: The exact quote of Proudhon is the following: &quot;The notion of anarchy in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order&quot; (1864).}}

Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself with the socialist factions of the workers movement. During his life of public service, he began advocating state-protected [[charter]]s for worker-owned [[cooperative]]s and promoting certain [[nationalisation]] schemes.{{cn|date=March 2019}}

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary [[contract]], [[federation]] and [[Monetary reform|credit and currency reform]]. According to the American mutualist [[William Batchelder Greene]], each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount&quot;.{{sfn|Greene|1875}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property [which] we call LIBERTY&quot;.{{sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187|ps=: The quote is from Proudhon's ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840).}}

==== Collectivist anarchism ====
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
[[Collectivist anarchism]], also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho-collectivism and referred to as revolutionary socialism or a [[Revolutionary socialism|form of such]],{{sfnm|1a1=Morris|1y=1993|1p=76|2a1=Rae|2y=1901|2p=261}} is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Johann Most]].{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=5}}

At the epicentre of collectivist anarchism lies the belief in the potential of humankind for goodness and solidarity which will flourish when oppressive governments are abolished.{{sfn|Heywood|2017|pp=146–147}} Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or propaganda by the deed, to inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} However, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by anarcho-communists as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.{{sfn|Kropotkin|2007|loc=chapter 13}} Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]], but it opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990|2ps=: &quot;They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up&quot;.}}

Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not [[mutually exclusive]]—although the collectivist anarchists advocated [[Labour voucher|compensation for labour]], some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.{{sfn|Guillaume|1972}}

==== Anarcho-communism ====
{{main|Anarcho-communism}}
{{anarcho-communism sidebar}}
[[File:Kropotkin2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Peter Kropotkin]] was influential in the development of [[anarcho-communism]]]]
[[Anarcho-communism]], also known as [[anarchist-communism]], [[communist anarchism]] and [[libertarian communism]], is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Market (economics)|markets]], [[money]], [[private property]] (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]){{sfn|Berkman|1929|ps=: Berkman explains: &quot;The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use. Thus, your watch is your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people&quot;.}} and [[capitalism]] in favour of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]],{{sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} [[direct democracy]] and a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal network]] of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–323}}

Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]],{{sfn|Graham|2005}} but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].{{sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} The theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]] took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections.{{sfn|Pengam}}

To date, the best known examples of an anarcho-communist society (i.e. established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]]{{sfn|Bookchin|2009|loc=Chapter 1. An Overview of the Spanish Libertarian Movement}} and the [[Free Territory]] during the [[Russian Revolution]]. Through the efforts and influence of the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]] during the Spanish Revolution within the [[Spanish Civil War]] starting in 1936, anarcho-communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of [[Revolutionary Catalonia|Catalonia]]. Along with the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]], it was crushed by the combined forces of the [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] as well as repression by the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (backed by the [[Soviet Union]]) and economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] itself.{{sfn|Bookchin|2009|ps=: Bookchin's quote: &quot;This process of education and class organization, more than any single factor in Spain, produced the collectives. And to the degree that the CNT-FAI (for the two organizations became fatally coupled after July 1936) exercised the major influence in an area, the collectives proved to be generally more durable, communist and resistant to Stalinist counterrevolution than other republican-held areas of Spain&quot;.}}

==== Anarcho-syndicalism ====
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|[[International Workers' Day|May Day]] 2010 demonstration of Spanish [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in Bilbao, Basque Country]]
{{anarcho-syndicalism sidebar}}
[[Anarcho-syndicalism]], also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism, is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the [[labour movement]].{{sfn|Isaacs|Sparks|2004|p=248}}

Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.{{sfn|Rocker|2004|p=73}}

Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or business agents—rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. [[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.{{sfn|Heywood|2017|pp=148–149}}

==== Individualist anarchism ====
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
[[Individualist anarchism]] refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.{{sfn|Ryner|2007}} Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy, but it instead refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', a book which some consider the first expression of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Everhart|1y=1982|1p=115|2a1=Philp|2y=2006|3a1=Adams|3y=2001|3p=116}} Godwin was a philosophical anarchist and from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.{{sfnm|1a1=Philp|1y=2006|2a1=Godwin|2y=1798}} Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=117}}

[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Stirner]] (here in a sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]) is usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist]]
An influential form of individualist anarchism called [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|egoism]],{{sfn|Goodway|2006|p=99}} or [[egoist anarchism]], was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German [[Max Stirner]].{{sfn|Leopold|2006}} Stirner's ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.{{sfn|Leopold|2006}} According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for God, state, or morality.{{sfn|Miller|1991|p=11}} To Stirner, rights were &quot;[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]&quot; in the mind and he held that society does not exist, but &quot;the individuals are its reality&quot;.{{sfn|Ossar|1980|p=27}} Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw [[Union of egoists|unions of egoists]], non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will,{{sfn|Ryley|2019|p=228}} which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=142}} Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.{{sfn|Carlson|1972|loc=chapter: Philosophical Egoism: German Antecedents}} &quot;Egoism&quot; has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and [[homosexual]] activist [[John Henry Mackay]].

[[Josiah Warren]] was a pioneer American anarcho-individualist, who drew inspiration from Proudhon.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=384–385}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, as well as his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Benjamin Tucker later fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

From these early influences, individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} [[free love]] and [[birth control]] advocates (see [[anarchism and issues related to love and sex]]),{{sfnm|1a1=McElroy|1y=1996|2a1=Díez|2y=2006}} individualist [[naturist]]s and [[nudist]]s (see [[anarcho-naturism]]),{{sfnm|1a1=Díez|1y=2006|2a1=Ytak|2y=2000}} [[freethought]] and [[anti-clerical]] activists{{sfnm|1a1=McElroy|1y=1981|1pp=291–304|2a1=Díez|2y=2007|2p=143}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and [[individual reclamation]]{{sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}} (see [[European individualist anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism in France]]). These authors and activists included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Emile Armand]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Henri Zisly]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], [[Adolf Brand]] and [[Lev Chernyi]], among others.

Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the [[anti-globalization movement]],{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence, though its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]], combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|Perlin|1979}}

[[Anti-capitalism]] stays prominent within contemporary anarchism, continuing the tradition of classical anarchism.{{sfn|Williams|2017|p=4}}

&lt;!-- Alphabetic order. --&gt;
[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see [[non-violence]]).{{sfn|Woodcock|1962}} It developed mostly in the Netherlands, Britain and the United States before and during the Second World War.{{sfn|Woodcock|1962}} [[Christian anarchism]] is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines anarchism and Christianity.{{sfn|Christoyannopoulos|2010|pp=2–4}} Its main proponents included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Dorothy Day]], [[Ammon Hennacy]] and [[Jacques Ellul]].

[[Anarcho-transhumanism]] is a recently new branch of anarchism that takes traditional and modern anarchism, typically drawing from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[left-libertarianism]], or [[Libertarian socialist|libertarian socialism]], and combines it with [[transhumanism]] and [[post-humanism]]. It can be described as a &quot;liberal democratic revolution, at its core the idea that people are happiest when they have rational control over their lives. Reason, science, and technology provide one kind of control, slowly freeing us from ignorance, toil, pain, disease and limited lifespans (aging)&quot;. Some anarcho-transhumanists might also follow [[technogaianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/anarchism/|title=Anarchism|last=Infoshop|date=2018-03-02|website=Infoshop|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free-market anarchism]], or [[market anarchism]], includes several branches of anarchism that advocate an economic system based on voluntary, market interactions without the involvement of the state. Certain individualist anarchists and mutualists supported this economic system. [[Left-wing market anarchism]] is a modern branch of free-market anarchism which strongly affirm the [[classical liberal]] ideas of [[self-ownership]] and [[free market]]s while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly [[anti-capitalist]], [[Anti-corporatism|anti-corporatist]], [[Social hierarchies|anti-hierarchical]] and [[Labour movement|pro-labour]] positions in economics; [[anti-imperialism]] in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding cultural issues such as gender, sexuality and race.

[[Green anarchism]], or [[eco-anarchism]], is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues,{{sfnm|1a1=Pepper|1y=1996|1p=44|2a1=Adams|2y=2001|2p=130}} with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism{{sfnm|1a1=Díez|1y=2006|2a1=Ortega|2y=2003}} and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]]. Writing from a green anarchist perspective, [[John Zerzan]] attributes the ills of today's social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization.{{sfn|Zerzan|2002}} While [[Layla AbdelRahim]] argues that &quot;the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies, whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby institutionalize violence&quot;.{{sfn|AbdelRahim|2015|p=8}} According to AbdelRahim, [[civilisation]] was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics. Language and literacy, she claims, are some of these technologies.{{sfnm|1a1=AbdelRahim|1y=2013|2a1=AbdelRahim|2y=2015}}

[[Insurrectionary anarchism]] is a revolutionary theory, practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises [[insurrection]] within anarchist practice. Critical of formal organisations such as [[labour unions]] and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses, insurrectionary anarchists instead advocate informal organisation and small [[affinity group]] based organisation as well as putting value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]] and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.

[[Platformism]] is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda's ''Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)''.{{sfn|Dielo Trouda|2006}} The document was based on the experiences of [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchists]] in the 1917 [[October Revolution]] which led eventually to the victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The ''Platform'' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the [[Russian Revolution]].

[[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-left anarchy, [[postmodernism]], [[autonomism]], [[postcolonialism]] and the [[Situationist International]].

[[Post-left anarchy]] is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional [[left-wing politics]]. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general also presenting a critique of organisations and [[morality]]. Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist [[Situationist International]], post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.{{sfn|Macphee|2007|loc=Introduction}}

[[Queer anarchism]] is a theory that suggests anarchism as a solution to the issues faced by the [[LGBT community]], mainly [[heteronormativity]], [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]] and [[biphobia]]. It arose during the late 20th century based on the work of [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976).

[[Religious anarchism]] refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of [[religion]]s. While many anarchists have traditionally been sceptical of and opposed to [[organized religion]], many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism, most notably [[Christianity]] as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy. Other examples include [[Buddhist anarchism]], [[Jewish anarchism]] and most recently [[Neopaganism]].

[[Synthesis anarchism]] is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the [[anarcho-communists]] [[Voline]] and [[Sébastien Faure]]. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global [[International of Anarchist Federations]].{{sfn|Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|2017|loc=J.3 What kinds of organisation do anarchists build?}}{{bcn|date=March 2019}}

==== Anarcha-feminism ====
{{main|Anarcha-feminism}}
[[Anarcha-feminism]], also called [[anarchist feminism]] and [[anarcho-feminism]], combines anarchism with [[feminism]]. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]] and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. Anarcha-feminists espoused to a detailed analysis of patriarchy and claim that oppression has its roots to social norms.{{sfn|Kowal|2019|p=275}}

Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=556}} [[Mujeres Libres]] was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women, based on the idea of a double struggle for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.{{sfn|Kowal|2019|p=271}} The second wave of anarcha-feminism arose in the 1960s.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=672–673}}

==== Anarcho-capitalism ====
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
[[Anarcho-capitalism]] advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self-ownership in a free market.{{sfnm|1a1=Hamowy|1y=2008|1pp=10–12, 195|2a1=Stringham|2y=2017|2p=51}} Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical American anti-state [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarianism]] and [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|individualist anarchism]],{{sfn|Outhwaite|2008|p=14}} drawing from [[Austrian School]] economics, study of [[law and economics]] and [[public choice theory]].{{sfn|Stringham|2005}} However, there is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as [[Anarchism and capitalism|incompatible]] with capitalist forms.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=565|ps=: &quot;In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists&quot;.}}{{sfn|Meltzer|2000|p=50|ps=: &quot;The philosophy of &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; dreamed up by the &quot;libertarian&quot; [[New Right]], has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper&quot;.}}{{sfn|Goodway|2006|p=4|ps=: &quot;'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition&quot;.}}{{sfn|Newman|2010|p=53|ps=: &quot;It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism)&quot;.}}

== Internal issues and debates ==
{{main|Issues in anarchism}}
&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought and disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. For instance, the compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfn|Honderich|1995|p=31}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]] and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]) and the [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. On a tactical level, [[propaganda of the deed]] was used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[nihilist movement]]), with some contemporary anarchists espousing alternative direct action methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones.{{sfn|Trevijano|2001|p=57}}

== Topics of interest ==
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.

=== Anarchism and free love ===
{{main|Free love}}
{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Queer anarchism}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[Anarchism in France|Parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]
An important current within anarchism is [[free love]].{{sfn|McElroy|1996}} In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand. He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].{{sfn|Ronsin|2000}} In Germany, the [[Stirnerism|Stirnerists]] Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux. Pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir. Fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

=== Anarchism and education ===
{{main|Anarchism and education}}
[[File:Francisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Anarchism in Spain|Catalan anarchist]] pedagogue and [[Freethought|free thinker]]]]
English anarchist William Godwin considered education an important aspect. He was against state education as he considered those schools as a way of the state to replicate privileges of the ruling class.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|p=514}} Godwin thought that education was the way to change the world. In his ''[[Political Justice]]'', he criticises state sponsored schooling and advocates for child's protection from coercion.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=197}} Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]'' in which Stirner was advocating for child's autonomy.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1p=521|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=222}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer|Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established [[Ferrer movement|modern]] or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Fidler|1985|pp=103–132}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both the state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils plenty of autonomy (i.e. on setting the curriculum). Ferrer was aiming to educate the working class. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later on arrested.{{sfnm|1a1=Bookchin|1y=1998|1p=115|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=511–514}} Ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] in the United States.{{sfn|Fidler|1985|pp=103–132}}

Russian Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate.{{sfn|Hern|2010}} Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.{{sfn|Wilson|2001|p=xxi}} Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.{{sfn|Hern|2010}} He thought that &quot;[e]ducation is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself. [...] Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary&quot;.{{sfn|Hern|2010}} For him, &quot;without compulsion, education was transformed into culture&quot;.{{sfn|Hern|2010}}

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.{{sfn|Purkis|2004}} Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=129}} However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.{{sfn|Suissa|2007}} In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.{{sfn|Illich|1971}}

=== Anarchism and the state ===
&lt;!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --&gt;
Objection to the state and its institutions is ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{sfn|Carter|1971|p=14}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and it is illegitimate regardless of political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless if it is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]] as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that some people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the argument that the state is the collective will of people as a fairy tale since the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of the society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}

[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|Which forms of violence, if any, are [[Anarchism and violence|consistent with anarchist values]] is a controversial subject among anarchists]]

=== Anarchism and violence ===
{{main|Anarchism and violence}}
Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexed and controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} On one hand, anarcho-pacifists point out the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|p=&quot;One significant philosophical and ethical problem for politically engaged anarchists is the question of how to avoid ongoing cycles of power and violence that are likely to erupt in the absence of centralized political power. One suggestion [...] is that anarchists will often want to emphasize the unity of means and ends. This idea shows why there is some substantial overlap and conjunction between anarchism and pacifism. Pacifist typically emphasize the unity of means and ends. But not all pacifists are anarchists&quot;}} On the other hand, other groups of anarchist are for direct action that can include sabotage or even terrorism. [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, were arguing that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]]. Peace activist and anarchist [[April Carter]] argues that violence is incompatible with anarchism because it is mostly associated with the state and authority as violence is immanent to the state. As the state's capability to exercise violence is colossal nowadays, a rebellion or civil war would probably end in another authoritarian institute.{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

=== Anarchist strategies and tactics ===
A broad categorization would be the preference of revolutionary tactics to destroy oppressive states and institutions or aiming to change society through evolutionary means. Revolutionary methods can take violent form as they did in past insurgencies (i.e. in Spain, Mexico and Russia) or during violent protests by militant protestors such as the [[black bloc]], who are generally much less violent than revolutionary movements a century ago. Anarchists also commonly employ [[direct action]] which can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchies, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2017|pp=4–5}} Often decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[Horizontalidad|horizontalism]]. Another aspect of anarchist tactics is their aim to strengthen social bonds through common actions.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–217}} Reclaiming public space by anarchists is another method of creating social spaces and creating squats in order to organise themselves. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[temporary autonomous zone]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2017|pp=5–6}}

== Criticism{{anchor|Criticisms}} ==
Moral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism, tacit authoritarianism and vandalism towards feats of civilisation.

=== Allegation of utopianism ===
Anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force&quot;. He also argued that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity&quot;.{{sfn|Landauer|1959}} However, ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' states the following: &quot;Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies&quot;. It also states that &quot;some sort of 'court' system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|1y=2017|1loc=A.2.16 Does anarchism require &quot;perfect&quot; people to work?|2a1=Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective|2y=2017|2loc=I.5.8 What about crime?}}

=== Industrial civilisation ===
In his essay ''On Authority'', [[Friedrich Engels]] claimed that radical [[decentralisation]] promoted by anarchists would destroy modern [[Industrial civilization|industrial civilisation]], citing an example of [[railway]]s and making the following point:{{sfn|Engels|1978}} {{quote|Here too the co-operation of an infinite number of individuals is absolutely necessary, and this co-operation must be practised during precisely fixed hours so that no accidents may happen. Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persona interested. In either case there is a very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train dispatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?}}

In the end, it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished.{{sfn|Goodwin|2014}}

=== Tacit authoritarianism ===
The anarchist tendency known as [[platformism]] has been criticised by [[Situationist International|Situationists]],{{sfn|Debord|1993|loc=Paragraph 91}} [[Insurrectionary anarchism|insurrectionaries]], [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesis anarchists]] and others of preserving tacitly statist, authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable, [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind /&gt; whose symptoms first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0 /&gt; People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pinel JP |title=Biopsychology |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, Massachusetts |edition=8th |isbn=978-0-205-03099-6 |oclc=1085798897 |page=235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers SJ | title = What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? | journal = Autism Res | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–137 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19582867 | pmc = 2791538 | doi = 10.1002/aur.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin /&gt; It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek /&gt; Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London /&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin /&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sacks O |author-link=Oliver Sacks |title=An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales |year=1995 |publisher=[[Alfred A.

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic [[toddler]]s differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and [[turn-taking]], and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar /&gt; Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate [[nonverbal autism|nonverbal]]ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A | title = Early detection of core deficits in autism | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–233 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15666338 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20046 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.492.9930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most children with autism display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van Ijzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA | title = Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–1134 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15257669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#Face perception in individuals with autism|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT | title = Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 327–355 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17716073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird G, Cook R | title = Mixed emotions: the contribution of alexithymia to the emotional symptoms of autism | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e285 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23880881 | pmc = 3731793 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2013.61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess /&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M |title= Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review |journal= Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume= 28 |issue=6 |pages= 567–579 |date= November 2007 |pmid= 16973329 |doi= 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams DL, Goldstein G, Minshew NJ | title = Neuropsychologic functioning in children with autism: further evidence for disordered complex information-processing | journal = Child Neuropsychol | volume = 12 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 279–298 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16911973 | pmc = 1803025 | doi = 10.1080/09297040600681190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman /&gt;

* [[Stereotypy|Stereotyped behaviors]]: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* [[Compulsive behavior]]s: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing.
* Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* [[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lam-Aman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–866 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14013119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
* [[Self-injury]]: Behaviors such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=John2007 /&gt;

No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH | title = Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–243 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11055459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005596502855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several diagnostic instruments are available.

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [[medical conditions]].&lt;ref name=Dover /&gt; A pediatric [[neuropsychologist]] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanne&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE | title = Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Neuropsychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–384 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18855144 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14769718}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover /&gt; such as [[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mantovani JF | title = Autistic regression and Landau–Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? | journal = Dev Med Child Neurol | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–353 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10855658 | doi = 10.1017/S0012162200210621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matson JL, Neal D | title = Cormorbidity: diagnosing comorbid psychiatric conditions | journal = Psychiatr Times | volume = 26 |issue=4 |year=2009|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130403062215/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 | archivedate = 3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna /&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ |title=Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Genet Med |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |year=2008 |pmid=18197051 |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |lay-url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |laydate=7 February 2008 |laysource=Medical News Today |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |access-date=7 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901151333/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |archivedate=1 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna /&gt; A [[Genotype-first approach|genotype-first]] model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledbetter DH | title = Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 359 | issue = 16 | pages = 1728–1730 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18784093 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMe0806570}}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Land2008 /&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dover&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover CJ, Le Couteur A | title = How to diagnose autism | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 540–545 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17515625 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2005.086280 | pmc=2066173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Girls are often diagnosed later than boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Why Many Autistic Girls are Overlooked|publisher=Child Mind Institute|url=https://childmind.org/article/autistic-girls-overlooked-undiagnosed-autism|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shattuck PT, Grosse SD | title = Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–135 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17563895 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research | vauthors = Cass H |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–138|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0 /&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin /&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A | title = Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 108–115 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19220594 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV-TR-299.00&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |edition=4th |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 |oclc=768475353 |lccn=00024852 |chapter-url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029080544/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |via=Centers for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD2007 /&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Freitag CM | title = The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–22 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17033636 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Lev2009 /&gt; They include:
* '''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''.

* '''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%.

* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steyaert JG, De la Marche W | title = What's new in autism? | journal = Eur J Pediatr | volume = 167 | issue = 10 | pages = 1091–1101 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597114 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 | url = https://www.academia.edu/24262348}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richdale AL, Schreck KA | title = Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–411 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398354 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning &quot;self&quot;), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn R | title = Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology | journal = Hist Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–366 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15386868 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04044603}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Soviet child psychiatrist, [[Grunya Sukhareva]], described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manouilenko I, Bejerot S|title=Sukhareva—Prior to Asperger and Kanner|access-date=|journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry|type=Report|publication-date=31 March 2015|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1761–1764|doi=10.3109/08039488.2015.1005022|issn=1502-4725|pmid=25826582|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical development and diagnoses ===
[[File:Leo-Kanner.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Balding man in his early 60s in coat and tie, with a serious but slightly smiling expression|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–1317 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans-title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot; /&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanner1943&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–250 |year=1943}} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title = Autistic disturbances of affective contact | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–136 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot; /&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–2023 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Triplett]] was the first person diagnosed with autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt; He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as &quot;case 1&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pallardy|first1=Richard| name-list-format = vanc |title=Donald Triplett|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Triplett|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=19 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlantic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donvan|first1=John|last2=Zucker|first2=Caren | name-list-format = vanc |title=Autism's First Child|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/autisms-first-child/308227/|access-date=19 March 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fombonne E | title = Modern views of autism | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–505 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp| doi = 10.1177/070674370304800801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology and distinction from schizophrenia ===
As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders | vauthors = Szatmari P, Jones MB | author-link1 = Peter Szatmari | pages=157–178 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-54957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot; /&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S | title = Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1320–1327 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18297387 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 | url = https://www.academia.edu/20027016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L | title = A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–330 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119473 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1980 for the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]] to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the [[DSM-III-R]] provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the [[DSM-5]] was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including [[PDD-NOS]], autism, [[Asperger syndrome]], [[Rett syndrome]], and [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|CDD]], has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker JP | title = Autism at 70--redrawing the boundaries | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 12 | pages = 1089–1091 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24047057 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1306380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biever C | title = Web removes social barriers for those with autism |journal=New Scientist |issue=2610 |pages=26–27 |year=2007 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020165135/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 |archivedate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism]] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that [[Neurodiversity|autism is simply another way of being]].&lt;ref name=Sil2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Frith2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Harmon A |title=How about not 'curing' us, some autistics are pleading |date=20 December 2004 |work=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002649/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autism rights movement ===
The [[autism rights movement]] is a [[social movement]] within the context of [[disability rights movement|disability right]]s that emphasizes the concept of [[neurodiversity]], viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the [[human brain]] rather than a disorder to be cured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot; /&gt; The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism;&lt;ref name=Bigthink&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ratner |first1=Paul |title=Should Autism Be Cured or Is &quot;Curing&quot; Offensive? |url=https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/should-autism-be-cured-or-is-curing-offfensive |website=Big Think |access-date=16 June 2019 |language=en |date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recognition of the autistic community as a [[minority group]].&lt;ref name=Bigthink /&gt;&lt;ref name= Jaarsma2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaarsma P, Welin S | title = Autism as a natural human variation: reflections on the claims of the neurodiversity movement | journal = Health Care Analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–30 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21311979 | doi = 10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 | url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-72172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the [[human genome]]. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and [[fringe theories]] that autism is caused by environmental factors such as [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot; /&gt; A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are &quot;[[High-functioning autism|high-functioning]]&quot; or have [[Asperger syndrome]] and do not represent the views of &quot;[[Low-functioning autism|low-functioning]]&quot; autistic people.&lt;ref name= Jaarsma2012 /&gt;

===Employment===
About half of autistics are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohl A, Grice Sheff M, Small S, Nguyen J, Paskor K, Zanjirian A | title = Predictors of employment status among adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder | journal = Work | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 345–355 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28211841 | doi = 10.3233/WOR-172492 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among autistics who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=DePillis |first1=Lydia | name-list-format = vanc |title=Disabled people are allowed to work for pennies per hour – but maybe not for much longer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/12/disabled-people-are-allowed-to-work-for-pennies-per-hour-but-maybe-not-for-much-longer/?noredirect=on |access-date=31 December 2018 |publisher=Washington Post |date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohl&quot;/&gt; A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganz ML | title = The lifetime distribution of the incremental societal costs of autism | journal = Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | volume = 161 | issue = 4 | pages = 343–349 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17404130 | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.161.4.343 | lay-url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2006-releases/press04252006.html | laydate = 25 April 2006 | laysource = Harvard School of Public Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montes G, Halterman JS | title = Association of childhood autism spectrum disorders and loss of family income | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = e821–26 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18381511 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-1594 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/4/e821 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100304071520/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/4/e821 | archivedate = 4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montes G, Halterman JS | title = Child care problems and employment among families with preschool-aged children with autism in the United States | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = e202–08 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18595965 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-3037 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/122/1/e202 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091206190622/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/122/1/e202 | archivedate = 6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}) ({{lang-la|albedo}}, meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] received by an [[astronomical body]] (e.g. a [[planet]] like [[Earth]]). It is [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] and measured (via an [[albedometer]]) on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of [[Radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] to the [[irradiance]] (flux per unit area) received by a surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |work=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editors=J. R. Holton and J. A. Curry |last=Coakley |first=J. A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2003|pages=1914–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see [[position of the Sun]]). While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson-Sellers |first=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M. F.|year=1983 |quote=Albedo observations of the Earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surface from Satellites |pages=285–294 |bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Encyclopedia |edition=3rd |publisher=Thompson Gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term albedo was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot;/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds (citation needed).

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;/&gt;). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot;/&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called [[ocean planet]] – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot;/&gt;

===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo===
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
* the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
* the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.
with &lt;math&gt;{1-D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot;/&gt;

== Astronomical albedo ==

The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong [[opposition effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through albedo-temperature feedback). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolation effects===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice-albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|journal=The Economist|access-date=8 May 2017|date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects [[climate]] by determining how much [[radiation]] a planet absorbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC&amp;pg=PA53|title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|last=Schneider|first=Stephen Henry|last2=Mastrandrea|first2=Michael D.|last3=Root|first3=Terry L.|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976532-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [[weather]].

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), ''Remote sensing of ice and snow''. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]).

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All About Sea Ice.&quot; National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of [[Global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland – Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic devices]]. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 |bibcode = 2013SoEn...91..233A | url = https://www.academia.edu/3081684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | authorlink4 = J.

===Trees===
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Betts | first1 = RA | date = 2000 | title = Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6809| pages = 187–190 | doi = 10.1038/35041545 | pmid=11089969|bibcode = 2000Natur.408..187B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004ClDy...22..597B | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1444B  | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt; Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Water===
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333)]]
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |accessdate=7 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|issue=6898|date=8 August 2002|url-status=dead|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846|last1=Travis|first1=D.

G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |date=30 May 1991|bibcode=1992JGR....9714565C |last1=Cahalan |first1=Robert F. |volume=97 |issue=D13 |page=14565 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres |doi=10.1029/92JD00799|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23842551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Spracklen et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean [[radiative forcing]] for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) (&quot;The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)&quot;); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. (&quot;The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3.&quot;); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) (&quot;The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the &quot;efficacy&quot; of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human activities===
Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

'''A''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] {{IPAc-en|'|eɪ}}, plural ''As'', ''A's'', ''a''s, ''a's'' or ''aes''{{refn|group=nb|''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is rendered ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, or a's.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}) is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and the first [[vowel]] of the [[English alphabet|modern English alphabet]] and the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It is similar to the [[Greek_alphabet#History|Ancient Greek letter]] [[alpha]], from which it derives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarter|1974|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in [[italic type]].

In the English grammar, &quot;a&quot;, and its variant &quot;an&quot;, is an [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]].

The earliest certain ancestor of &quot;A&quot; is [[aleph]] (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted entirely of [[consonant]]s (for that reason, it is also called an [[abjad]] to distinguish it from a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]&lt;ref name=Coll&gt;{{harvnb|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] [[aleph]].

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [[glottal stop]]—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.

===Typographic variants===
[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter &quot;A&quot;. First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other &quot;permanent&quot; media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the &quot;perishable&quot; nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.&lt;ref name=Americana&gt;{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LowercaseA.svg|left|thumb|200px|[[Allography|Typographic variants]] include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''ɑ'''.]]At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt;

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (&quot;a&quot;).&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' (&quot;ɑ&quot;), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin &quot;a&quot; (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).

==Use in writing systems==
[[File:Pronunciation_of_the_name_of_the_letter_⟨a⟩_in_European_languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages, note that /a/ and /aː/ can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|ä}}, {{IPAblink|æ}} and {{IPAblink|ɑ}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]
===English===
{{further information|Pronunciation of English ⟨a⟩}}
In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/æ/}} as in ''pad'';
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɑː/}} as in ''father'', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;
*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) – this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]];
*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in ''square'' and ''Mary'';
*the rounded vowel of ''water'';
*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in ''was'' and ''what'';&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;
*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''.

The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''Aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English texts tend to be {{angbr|a}}, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other languages===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|ä]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|ɑ]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[Á]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

===Other systems===

In phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr IPA|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr IPA|ä}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr IPA|ɑ}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==Other uses==
{{main article|A (disambiguation)}}
In [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') are used to denote unknown quantities.

In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; &quot;A grade&quot; for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciani &amp; Sheldon|2010|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is used as a prefix on some words, such as [[asymmetry]], to mean &quot;not&quot; or &quot;without&quot; (from Greek).

In English grammar, &quot;a&quot;, and its variant &quot;an&quot;, is an [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]].

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Alabama''' ({{IPAc-en|,|æ|l|ə|'|b|æ|m|ə|}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southern United States|southeastern region]] of the [[United States]]. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|30th largest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|24th-most populous]] of the [[List of U.S. states|U.S. states]]. With a total of {{convert|1500|mi|km}} of [[inland waterway]]s, Alabama has among the most of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alabama Transportation Overview |url=https://www.edpa.org/wp-content/uploads/Alabama-Transportation-Overview-1.pdf |publisher=Economic Development Partnership of Alabama |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is nicknamed the ''[[Northern flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;Heart of [[Dixie]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Cotton]] State&quot;. The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[longleaf pine]], and the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[camellia]]. Alabama's capital is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. The largest city by population is [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]],&lt;ref name=&quot;quickcensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=Alabama |website=QuickFacts |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910132303/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has long been the most industrialized city; the largest city by land area is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. The oldest city is [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], founded by French [[colonists]] in 1702 as the capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pelican&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomason |first=Michael |title=Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City|year=2001 |publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=978-0-8173-1065-3|pages=2–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama, like many states in the [[southern U.S.]], suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against African Americans from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and [[African Americans]] were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008–2018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization.

Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; Organized [[insurgent]], resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original [[Ku Klux Klan]], these included the Pale Faces, [[Knights of the White Camellia]], [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], and the [[White League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt;

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; and the legislature passed the [[Blaine Amendment]], prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |title=A Blaine Amendment Update (July 00) |publisher=Schoolreport.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014339/http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, legislation was approved that called for [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classroomhelp.com/till/jimcrowlaws/jimcrowalabama.html |title=Jim Crow Laws in Alabama |website=Emmett Till, It All Began with a Whistle |publisher=Classroomhelp |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt; After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more [[Jim Crow laws]] at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.

The new 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]] included provisions for voter registration that effectively [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and [[literacy test]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Kousser. ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were [[literate]]. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |title=Segregation (Jim Crow) |last= |first=|date= |website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|language=en |access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |accessdate =September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |journal= Southern Spaces |publisher= Emory University|doi= 10.18737/M70K6P |last1= Tullos |first1= Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS |website=National Register Information System |url={{NRHP url|id=64500011}} |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African-American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state.

Continued racial discrimination and [[lynching]]s, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hine |first1=Darlene |last2=Hine |first2=William |last3=Harrold |first3=Stanley |title=African Americans: A Concise History |date=2012 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=9780205806270 |pages=388–389 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |title=Great Migration {{!}} African-American history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2018-05-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;historical populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;census data&quot; /&gt;

At the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] to work in new industrial jobs.

{{quote|Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial &quot;[[gerrymandering]]&quot; violated the Constitution. In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot;&gt;James Blacksher, Edward Still, Nick Quinton, Cullen Brown and Royal Dumas.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomason2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomason |first1=Michael |title=Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city |date=2001 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa |isbn=0-8173-1065-7 |pages=213–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary.

In the United States Supreme Court cases of ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the court ruled ruled that the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot; needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as Alabama had used for its senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2023 |title=Reynolds v.

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot; /&gt; Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the [[civil rights movement]], including legal challenges. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor [[George Wallace]], Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for [[desegregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I5JJCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94&amp;dq=alabama+brown+v.+board#v=onepage&amp;q=alabama%20brown%20v.%20board |title=Brown v.

Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot; /&gt;

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;cum&quot;&gt;[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 &quot;Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)&quot;/&quot;Proportional Voting in Alabama&quot;], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&amp;nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorm]]s. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]]; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 2004–2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010029/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf |date=April 27, 2014}}.

[[File:Birmingham city hall alabama 2010.jpg|thumb|Snowfall outside Birmingham City Hall in February 2010]]
The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[Southeastern United States]], with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|°F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]]. The record low of {{convert|-27|°F}} occurred on January 30, 1966, in [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |title=Record high and low temperatures for all 50 states |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=accuracyproject.org |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US01&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR2&amp;-ds_name=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization.&lt;ref name=&quot;census-ancestries&quot;&gt;[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.jpg &quot;Census 2000 Map – Top U.S. Ancestries by County&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.361–368&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the [[Alabama Indian Affairs Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aiac&quot;&gt;[http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx &quot;Alabama Indian Affairs Commission&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003045646/http://www.aiac.state.al.us/tribes.aspx |date=October 3, 2013}}, State of Alabama, accessed September 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.

The state has [[State recognized tribes in the United States|officially recognized]] nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the American Southeast. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |title=AIAC Bylaws |website=Alabama Indian Affairs Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918101025/http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |archivedate=September 18, 2012 |df= mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
95.1% of all Alabama residents five years old or older spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly [[Southern American English|Southern]],&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Alabama-Languages.html |title=Alabama – Languages |website=city-data.com |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from [[Tennessee]]. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of 'bird'. In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland 'arm' and 'barb' rhyming with 'form' and 'orb'. Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (clingstone), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons).&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data.com&quot;/&gt;

Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]], a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html |title=Church or synagogue attendance by state |website=The San Diego Union-Tribune |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513103435/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060502/news_lz1n2thelist.html |archivedate=May 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. {{as of|2010}}, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[The United Methodist Church]], and [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational]] Evangelical Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives |title=State membership Report |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012074403/http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the [[United Methodist Church]] with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the [[Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The [[Assemblies of God]] had almost 60,000 members, the [[Churches of Christ]] had nearly 120,000 members. The [[Presbyterian church]]es, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 ([[Presbyterian Church in America|PCA]] – 28,009 members in 108 congregations, [[PC(USA)]] – 26,247 members in 147 congregations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives |title=Maps &amp; Reports |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012074403/http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/01/rcms2010_01_state_name_2010.asp |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] – 6,000 members in 59 congregations, the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America]] – 5,000 members and 50 congregations plus the [[Edgewater Presbyterian Church|EPC]] and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations).&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/01_2000.asp |title=State Membership Reports |year=2000 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |publisher=thearda.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829192301/http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/01_2000.asp |archive-date=August 29, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian [[Canonical Gospels|Gospels]].

==Law and government==

===State government===
{{main|Government of Alabama}}
[[File:Alabama Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol Building]] in Montgomery, completed in 1851]]

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the [[Alabama Constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lockette, [http://www.annistonstar.com/article_c928bd51-fbf1-5056-a30c-1bf4b19eb012.html?mode=jqm Is the Alabama Constitution the longest constitution in the world?Truth Rating: 4 out of 5], ''Anniston Star''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/us/alabama-simmers-before-vote-on-its-constitutions-racist-language.html Alabama Simmers Before Vote on Its Constitution's Racist Language], ''New York Times'', October 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16443-2004Nov27 |last=Roig-Franzia |first=Manuel |title=Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds |work=The Washington Post |date=November 28, 2004 |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |title=Constitution of Alabama – 1901 |website=The Alabama Legislative Information System |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923081542/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |archivedate=September 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archivedate=September 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.

[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]

Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.

[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]]. She is the only Republican female governor in the state's history.]]
The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor of Alabama]], the [[Attorney General of Alabama|attorney general of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State|Alabama secretary of state]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer|Alabama state treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama|state auditor of Alabama]]. The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]].

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |title=Alabama's Legislative Process |first=McDowell |last=Lee |year=2009 |publisher=State of Alabama |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162559/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |archivedate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the state's [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;&gt;[http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL Judicial Selection in the States: Alabama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162358/http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL |date=October 6, 2014}}, American Judicature Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[chief justice]] of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Tom Parker (judge)|Tom Parker]]. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party.

===Taxes===
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent [[State income tax|personal income tax]], depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]] from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the [[standard deduction]]. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]] (Social Security and Medicare tax).

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |title=Alabama State Local Tax Burden Compared to U.S. Average (1970–2007) |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |website=Tax Foundation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605100516/http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Property tax]]es are the lowest in the U.S. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&amp;nbsp;million.

===County and local governments===
{{see also|List of counties in Alabama}}
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;/&gt; Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

&quot;The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P. Brewer, &quot;Home Rule&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama'', 2007, accessed February 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]], meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The [[Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board]] controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. Twenty-five of the 67 counties are &quot;[[Dry county|dry counties]]&quot; which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcboard.alabama.gov/%28S%28s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb%29%29/wet_dry_map.aspx Wet-Dry Map] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009231316/http://abcboard.alabama.gov/(S(s1j4zjl5nddpfshvrhppmpsb))/wet_dry_map.aspx |date=October 9, 2016}}, Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.

After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
{{main|Elections in Alabama}}
[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]

====State elections====
With the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are [[Steve Windom]] (1999–2003), [[Kay Ivey]] (2011–2017), and [[Will Ainsworth]] (2019–present).

====Local elections====
Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results – Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results – Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, [[at-large]] races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. The current split is 35 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], 31 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]], and one Independent Fayette.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/pages?id=41 |title=Alabama Sheriffs 2015–2019 |website=www.alabamasheriffs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. {{as of|2015}}, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in [[Morgan County, Alabama]], and ten African-American sheriffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA&quot;/&gt;

====Federal elections====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are Republican [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]] and Democrat [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]]. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.

In the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Bradley Byrne]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Morris J. Brooks]], [[Martha Roby]], and [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]] who represents the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] as well as most of the predominantly black portions of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] and [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].

==Education==
{{main|Education in Alabama}}

===Primary and secondary education===
[[File:Vestavia Hills High School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vestavia Hills High School]] in the suburbs of Birmingham]]

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |title= Alabama Education Quick Facts 2012–13 |accessdate =April 29, 2014 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, over 82&amp;nbsp;percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |title=Educational Attainment : 2000 : Census 2000 Brief |website=Census.gov |accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics]. CensusScope.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Although unusual in the West, [[school corporal punishment]] is not uncommon in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students [[paddle (spanking)|paddled]] at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.&lt;ref&gt;This figure refers to only the number of students paddled, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be higher.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot; /&gt; The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed only by Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |publisher=[[World Corporal Punishment Research]] |last = Farrell |first = Colin | date=February 2016 |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) ([[University of Alabama School of Medicine]], [[University of South Alabama]] and [[Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine]] and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine – Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges ([[Auburn University]] and [[Tuskegee University]]), a dental school ([[University of Alabama School of Dentistry]]), an optometry college ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]), two pharmacy schools ([[Auburn University]] and [[Samford University]]), and five law schools ([[University of Alabama School of Law]], [[Birmingham School of Law]], [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Miles Law School]], and the [[Thomas Goode Jones School of Law]]). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the [[Alabama Commission on Higher Education]] and the [[Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education]]. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ache&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Alabama Commission on Higher Education |title=Directory of Alabama Colleges and Universities |url=http://www.ache.alabama.gov/Colleges&amp;Universities/Directory.htm |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002457/http://www.ache.alabama.gov/Colleges%26Universities/Directory.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Transportation in Alabama}}

===Aviation===
{{main|Aviation in Alabama}}

Major airports with sustained commercial operations in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), and [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals – Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] (MSL).

===Rail===
For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at [[Anniston station|Anniston]], [[Birmingham station (Alabama)|Birmingham]], and [[Tuscaloosa station|Tuscaloosa]].

===Roads===
Alabama has six major interstate roads that cross the state: [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate&amp;nbsp;65]] (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59 in Alabama|I-59]] travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]; [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|I-85]] originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. [[Interstate 22 in Alabama|I-22]] enters the state from [[Mississippi]] and connects Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165 (Alabama)|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Decatur and Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685|I-685]], will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]]. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, [[Interstate 222|I-222]] has been proposed, as well.

Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route&amp;nbsp;11]] (US-11), [[U.S. Route 29 in Alabama|US-29]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US-31]], [[U.S. Route 43 in Alabama|US-43]], [[U.S. Route 45 in Alabama|US-45]], [[U.S. Route 72 in Alabama|US-72]], [[U.S. Route 78 in Alabama|US-78]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|US-80]], [[U.S. Route 82 in Alabama|US-82]], [[U.S. Route 84 in Alabama|US-84]], [[U.S. Route 90 in Alabama|US-90]], [[U.S. Route 98 in Alabama|US-98]], [[U.S. Route 231 in Alabama|US-231]], [[U.S. Route 278 in Alabama|US-278]], [[U.S. Route 280 in Alabama|US-280]], [[U.S. Route 331 in Alabama|US-331]], [[U.S. Route 411 in Alabama|US-411]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]].

There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]; Tuscaloosa Bypass in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]; Emerald Mountain Expressway in [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]]; and Beach Express in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]].

===Ports===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]]. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonstraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 1086.

{{Greek myth}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' or '''Achilleus''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|iː|z}} {{respell|ə|KIL|eez}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀχιλλεύς}}, ''Achilleus'' {{IPA-el|a.kʰil.'leu̯s|}}) was a hero of the [[Trojan War]], the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the central character of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. He was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], king of [[Phthia]].

Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with [[Statius]]' unfinished epic ''[[Achilleid]]'', written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because, when his mother [[Thetis]] dipped him in the river [[Styx]] as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term &quot;[[Achilles' heel]]&quot; has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The [[Achilles tendon]] is also named after him due to these legends.

Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{lang|grc|ἄχος}} (''{{transl|grc|áchos}}'') &quot;distress, pain, sorrow, grief&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scholia to the ''Iliad'', 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|λαός}} (''{{transl|grc|laós}}'') &quot;people, soldiers, nation&quot;, resulting in a proto-form ''*Akhí-lāu̯os'' &quot;he who has the people distressed&quot; or &quot;he whose people have distress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Palmer|title=The Interpretation of Mycenaean Greek Texts|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1963|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagy&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory Nagy|title=The best of the Achaeans|url=http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5442|website=CHS|publisher=The Center for Hellenic Studies, Harvard University|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of {{lang|grc|κλέος}} ''{{transl|grc|kléos}}'' (&quot;glory&quot;, usually in war). Furthermore, ''laós'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following [[Leonard Palmer]], to mean &quot;a corps of soldiers&quot;, a [[muster (military)|muster]].&lt;ref name=Nagy/&gt; With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

[[File:The Education of Achilles 1862 Delacroix.jpg|thumb|right|''The Education of Achilles'', by [[Eugène Delacroix]], pastel on paper, c.&amp;nbsp;1862 ([[Getty Center]], Los Angeles)]]

Another etymology relates the name to a [[Proto-Indo-European]] [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''*h₂eḱ-pṓds'' &quot;sharp foot&quot; which first gave an [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] ''*āk̂pediós'', evolving through time into ''*ākhpdeós'' and then ''*akhiddeús''. The shift from ''-dd-'' to ''-ll-'' is then ascribed to the passing of the name into Greek via a [[Pre-Greek]] source. The first root part ''*h₂eḱ-'' &quot;sharp, pointed&quot; also gave Greek ἀκή (''akḗ'' &quot;point, silence, healing&quot;), ἀκμή (''akmḗ'' &quot;point, edge, zenith&quot;) and ὀξύς (''oxús'' &quot;sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever&quot;), whereas ἄχος stems from the root ''*h₂egʰ-'' &quot;to be upset, afraid&quot;. The whole expression would be comparable to the [[Latin]] ''acupedius'' &quot;swift of foot&quot;. Compare also the Latin word family of ''aciēs'' &quot;sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement&quot;, ''acus'' &quot;needle, pin, bodkin&quot;, and ''acuō'' &quot;to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse&quot; (whence ''acute'').&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Wiktionary entries [[wikt:Ἀχιλλεύς|&quot;Ἀχιλλεύς&quot;]] and [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₂eḱ-|''*h₂eḱ-'']].&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Literary topos|topical]] [[epitheta]] of Achilles in the ''Iliad'' point to this &quot;swift-footedness&quot;, namely ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεὺς (''podárkēs dĩos Achilleús'' &quot;swift-footed divine Achilles&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 1.121, 2.688.&lt;/ref&gt; or, even more frequently, πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς (''pódas ōkús Achilleús'' &quot;quick-footed Achilles&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;E. g. ''Iliad'' 1.58, 1.84, 1.148, 1.215, 1.364, 1.489.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers deem the name a [[loan word]], possibly from a [[Pre-Greek]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt; Achilles' descent from the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and a similarity of his name with those of [[Potamoi|river deities]] such as [[Acheron]] and [[Achelous]] have led to speculations about him being an old [[Greek sea gods|water divinity]] (see below [[Achilles#Worship|Worship]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the supportive position of {{cite journal|author=Hildebrecht Hommel|title=Der Gott Achilleus|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38–44}}&amp;nbsp;– A critical point of view is taken by {{cite journal|author=J. T. Hooker|title=The cults of Achilleus|journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of ''-λλ-'' and ''-λ-'' in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /l&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;/ in the original language.&lt;ref name=Beekes&gt;Robert S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 183ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth and early years ==

Achilles was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and of [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by [[Themis]], goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755–768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34–37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26–47; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 181.jpg|thumb|left|''Thetis Dipping the Infant Achilles into the River Styx'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1625; [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], Rotterdam)]]

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the ''[[Argonautica]]'' (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god [[Nereus]], was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' (c. 1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] ([[Yale Center for British Art]])]]

According to the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD, and to [[Lost works|non-surviving previous sources]], when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]].&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Achilleid'' 1.269; Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 107.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Jonathan S. Burgess| title = The Death and Afterlife of Achilles| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ko_YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9| accessdate = 5 February 2010| year = 2009| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| location = Baltimore| isbn = 978-0-8018-9029-1| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Achilles' heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]]). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, none of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of [[Pelagon]], challenged Achilles by the river [[Scamander]]. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood&quot;.

Also, in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which one can find description of the hero's death (i.e. the ''[[Cypria]]'', the ''[[Little Iliad]]'' by [[Lesches]] of Pyrrha, the ''[[Aithiopis]]'' and ''[[Iliou persis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]]), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel; in the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on [[Mount Pelion]], to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87–89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830–832.&lt;/ref&gt; Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan war.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.410ff.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Homer, Achilles grew up in Phthia together with his companion [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Photius]], the sixth book of the ''New History'' by [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; but when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron. Later Chiron exhumed the body of the [[Damysus (Giant)|Damysus]], who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles' burnt foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_copyright/photius_05bibliotheca.htm Photius, ''Bibliotheca'', cod. 190]: &quot;Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; six were born; when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed and tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to Chiron.  The latter exhumed the body of the giant Damysos who was buried at Pallene—Damysos was the fastest of all the giants—removed the 'astragale' and incorporated it into Achilles' foot using 'ingredients'.  This 'astragale' fell when Achilles was pursued by Apollo and it was thus that Achilles, fallen, was killed.  It is said, on the other hand, that he was called Podarkes by the Poet, because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arce and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arce.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other names ===

=== Hidden on Skyros ===
{{main|Achilles on Skyros}}

Some post-Homeric sources&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Skyrioi'', surviving only in fragmentary form; [[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], ''Imagines'' i; Scholiast on Homer's ''Iliad'', 9.326; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 13.162–180; Ovid, ''[[Tristia]]'' 2.409–412 (mentioning a Roman tragedy on this subject); Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.8; [[Statius]], ''[[Achilleid]]'' 1.689–880, 2.167ff.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]]. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewellery and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

== In the Trojan War ==

[[File:Achilles Agamemnon Pompei mosaic NAMNaples 10006.jpg|thumb|Achilles and [[Agamemnon]], from a [[fresco]] of [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD]]

According to the ''Iliad'', Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[Myrmidons]]. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, [[Eudorus]], Peisander, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and Alcimedon.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 16.168–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telephus ===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos]], where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pseudo-Apollodorus|title=Bibliotheca, Epitome 3.20|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#69|website=theoi.com|ref=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' [[lost works|lost play]] about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot;/&gt;

=== Troilus ===

[[File:Achilles slaying Troilus.PNG|thumb|left|Achilles slaying Troilus, red-figure kylix signed by [[Euphronios]]]]

According to the ''[[Cypria]]'' (the part of the [[Epic Cycle]] that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' wrath), when the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of [[Aeneas]], sacked neighbouring cities (like [[Pedasus]] and [[Lyrnessus]], where the Greeks capture the queen [[Briseis]]) and killed [[Tenes]], a son of [[Apollo]], as well as Priam's son [[Troilus]] in the sanctuary of [[Apollo]] [[Thymbra]]ios.&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the romance between Troilus and [[Chryseis]] described in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' and in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' is a medieval invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot;/&gt;

Cf. [[Vergil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.474–478.&lt;/ref&gt; Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister [[Polyxena]], and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth&amp;nbsp;– who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo [[Thymbra]]ios.&lt;ref name=GreekMyth&gt;[https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Troilus/troilus.html&quot;&gt;Troilus: GreekMythology.com] accessed September 30, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca Epitome'' 3.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia to [[Lycophron]] 307; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], Scholia to the ''Aeneid'' 1.474.&lt;/ref&gt; In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.&lt;ref name=GreekMyth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html &quot;Zeus Be Nice Now&quot;] in ''London Review of Books'', 19 July 2007. Accessed 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the [[First Vatican Mythographer]] claimed, Troy would have been invincible.&lt;ref&gt;The motif, however, is older and found already in [[Plautus]], [[Bacchides (Plautus)|''Bacchides'']] 953ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the ''Iliad'' ===
{{main|Iliad}}

[[File:Achilles Briseis MAN Napoli Inv9105 n01.jpg|thumb|Achilles cedes [[Briseis]] to [[Agamemnon]], from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], fresco, 1st century AD ([[Naples National Archaeological Museum]])]]

Homer's ''Iliad'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, ''mênis Achilléōs'') is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος&lt;br&gt;
οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκε, […]
|Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,&lt;br&gt;
the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the Achaeans, […]
|}

The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]], the daughter of [[Briseus]], be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis),&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334–343.&lt;/ref&gt; with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles [[Homeric prayer|prays]] to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]], to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

[[File:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|left|''The Rage of Achilles'', fresco by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1757, Villa Valmarana ai Nani, Vicenza)]]

The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, wearing Achilles' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]], who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991: 22.346.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lattimore |first1=Richmond |title=The Illiad of Homer |date=2011 |publisher=The University of Chicago |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-46937-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/iliad00home_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion's dog ([[Sirius]]); a sign of evil. During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to [[Hesperus]], the evening/western star ([[Venus]]), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]], the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]] (Argeiphontes), Hector's father [[Priam]] goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of [[Niobe]]'s offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

=== Later epic accounts: fighting Penthesilea and Memnon ===

[[File:Akhilleus Memnon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1410.jpg|thumb|Achilles and Memnon fighting, between Thetis and Eos, Attic black-figure amphora, c. 510 BC, from Vulci]]

The ''[[Aethiopis]]'' (7th century BC) and a work named ''[[Posthomerica]]'', composed by [[Quintus of Smyrna]] in the fourth century AD, relate further events from the [[Trojan War]]. When [[Penthesilea]], queen of the [[Amazons]] and daughter of [[Ares]], arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]], 3.11.15; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.&lt;!--- Sources for this? &quot;Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (Amazon)|Helene]].&quot; --&gt;

Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son [[Antilochus]] becomes Achilles' closest companion. When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], son of the Dawn Goddess [[Eos]] and king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]], slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise, until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad''{{'}}s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century BC. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. [[Homer]] does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Tribal Imagination: Civilization and the Savage Mind |author= Robin Fox |year= 2011 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674060944 |quote= There is certainly no evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers.|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCxy_4Bt1F0C&amp;pg=PA223 223]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life|last= Martin |first= Thomas R |year= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0521148443 |quote= The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers. Achilles and his equally close friend Patroclus provided the legendary model for this friendship, but Homer in the ''Iliad'' never suggested that they had sex with each other. (That came from later authors.) If Alexander and Hephaestion did have a sexual relationship, it would have been transgressive by majority Greek standards ... |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the ''Iliad'' that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'']]. In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673–674.&lt;/ref&gt; But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.

=== Death ===
{{anchor|Fatalwound}}

The death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions.&lt;ref&gt;Abrantes 2016: c. 4.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest one, the [[Iliad]], and as predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, the hero's death was brought about by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]].

[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|left|''Dying Achilles'' (Achilleas thniskon) in the gardens of the Achilleion]]

Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.

In the ''Odyssey'', Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his [[mound]] at the [[Hellespont]] while they are receiving the dead [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]] in Hades.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 24.36–94.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Book 11 of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 11.467–564.&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.

According to some accounts, he had married [[Medea]] in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] of [[Hades]]&amp;nbsp;– as Hera promised Thetis in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' (3rd century BC).

=== Fate of Achilles' armour ===

[[File:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|right|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles, [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure [[lekythos]] from Sicily (c. 510 BC - [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich)]]

Achilles' armour was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'', 1973, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': ''Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing'' (1980:65–85, especially 81).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achilles, Ajax and a game of ''petteia'' ===

Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] were playing a [[board game]] (''petteia'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html &quot;Petteia&quot;.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209122834/http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html |date=9 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html &quot;Greek Board Games&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408090534/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html |date=8 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html &quot;Latrunculi&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915044905/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioannis Kakridis]] (1988).

The spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greeks]] that had [[Second Greek colonisation|settled]] on the northern coast of the [[Pontus Euxinus]], today's Black Sea, appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the [[Miletus|Milesian]] colony of [[Olbia (archaeological site)|Olbia]] as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] Зміїний, ''Zmiinyi'', near [[Kiliya]], [[Ukraine]]). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the [[Greek colonies]] on the [[Black Sea]] ([[graffiti]] and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being [[votive offering]]s, from Olbia, the area of [[Berezan Island]] and the [[Tauric Chersonese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hildebrecht Hommel|title=Der Gott Achilleus|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;) attest the existence of a [[heroic cult]] of Achilles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. T. Hooker|title=The cults of Achilleus|journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century AD, when dedicatory [[stelae]] from Olbia refer to an ''Achilles Pontárchēs'' (Ποντάρχης, roughly &quot;lord of the Sea,&quot; or &quot;of the [[Pontus Euxinus]]&quot;), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with [[Olympian gods]] such as the local [[Apollo]] Prostates, [[Hermes]] Agoraeus,&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; or [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Smyrnaeus, 3.770–779.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD) in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' mentions a &quot;port of the Achæi&quot; and an &quot;island of Achilles&quot;, famous for the tomb of that &quot;man&quot; (portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]]; furthermore, at 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s from this island, he places a peninsula &quot;which stretches forth in the shape of a sword&quot; obliquely, called ''Dromos Achilleos'' (Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος, ''Achilléōs drómos'' &quot;[[Racecourse of Achilles|the Race-course of Achilles]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.12.83 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D26#note-link10 chapter 4.26]).&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic [[Spit (landform)|spit]], called today ''Tendra'' (or ''Kosa Tendra'' and ''Kosa Djarilgatch''), situated between the mouth of the [[Dnieper]] and [[Karkinit Bay]], but which is hardly 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s (c. 185&amp;nbsp;km) away from the [[Dnieper-Bug estuary]], as Pliny states. (To the &quot;Race-course&quot; he gives a length of 80&amp;nbsp;miles, c.&amp;nbsp;120&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the spit measures c.&amp;nbsp;70&amp;nbsp;km today.)

In the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as ''Achillea'' and introduces two further names for it: ''Leuce'' or ''Macaron'' (from Greek [νῆσος] μακαρῶν &quot;island of the blest&quot;). The &quot;present day&quot; measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of ''Achillea'' or ''Leuce'' with today's Snake Island.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.13.93 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D27 chapter 4.27]): &quot;Researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120 from [[Tyras]], and of fifty from the island of [[Peuce Island|Peuce]]. It is about ten miles in circumference.&quot; Though afterwards he speaks again of &quot;the remaining islands in the Gulf of [[Kerkinitis|Carcinites]]&quot; which are &quot;Cephalonesos, Rhosphodusa [or Spodusa], and Macra&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's contemporary [[Pomponius Mela]] (c. 43 AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named ''Achillea'', situated between the [[Borysthenes]] and the [[Danube|Ister]], adding to the geographical confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Pomponius Mela, ''De situ orbis'' 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823 on Snake Island. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC [[Black-glazed Ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: &quot;Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke.&quot; In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt;

The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on ''Leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''[[Aethiopis]]'' according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical Λεύκη Νῆσος (''Leúkē Nêsos'' &quot;White Island&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''Chrestomathia'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the fifth century BC, [[Pindar]] had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a &quot;bright island&quot; (φαεννά νᾶσος, ''phaenná nâsos'') of the Black Sea,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.49ff.; Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[Island of the Blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[Peleus]] and [[Cadmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Olympia'' 2.78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Well known is the connection of these mythological [[Fortunate Isles]] (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, ''makárôn nêsoi'') or the Homeric [[Elysium]] with the stream [[Oceanus]] which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt; Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], speaking of &quot;Achilles lord of Scythia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D. Page, ''Lyrica Graeca Selecta'', Oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles' fight against the [[Aethiopia]]n prince [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[Eos]] after his death.

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' (c. 130 AD) gives the following details:

{{quote|It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus' honour, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honour Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles' temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles' honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles' oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn't run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Densuşianu&quot;/&gt;}}

The Greek geographer [[Dionysius Periegetes]], who lived probably during the first century AD, wrote that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Periegetes, ''Orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.&lt;ref name=Hedreen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21; Scholion to Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the [[Delphi]]c [[Pythia]] sent a lord of [[Crotone|Croton]] to be cured of a chest wound.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Strabo]] reported on the existence of a town ''Achílleion'' (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from [[Mytilene]] in the sixth century BC, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the [[Troad]].&lt;ref name=Troad/&gt; Later attestations point to an ''Achílleion'' in [[Messenia]] (according to [[Stephanus Byzantinus]]) and an ''Achílleios'' (Ἀχίλλειος) in [[Laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.25.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of [[Aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called [[Chilia Veche|Chilia]] (presumably from an older ''Achileii''), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Densuşianu&quot;&gt;Nicolae Densuşianu: ''Dacia preistorică''. Bucharest: Carol Göbl, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception during antiquity ==
=== In Greek tragedy ===
{{main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}
The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'', a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radt. ''Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149–157a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; [[Euripides]] refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;&gt;Latacz 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Greek philosophy ===
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centred one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;[[Epithets in Homer#Individuals|swift-footed]]&quot; [[Zeno's paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

=== Achilles in Roman and medieval literature ===
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;/&gt; [[Virgil]] refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.28, 1.30, 3.87.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Horace]] portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 4.6.17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, such as [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]] and in [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]'s ''[[Roman de Troie]]'' and [[Guido delle Colonne]]'s ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the [[Matter of Troy]] until the 17th century.

Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler [[Leo the Deacon]], not as [[Hellenes|Hellene]], but as [[Scythians|Scythian]], while according to the Byzantine author [[John Malalas]], his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekonomou|first1=Andrew|title=Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=UK|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zomZk6DbFTIC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20malalas%20myrmidons%20achilles|accessdate=14 September 2015|isbn=9780739119778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Croke|first2=Brian|title=Studies in John Malalas|location=Australian Association for Byzantine Studies, Department of Modern Greek, University of Sydney|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p55mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&amp;dq=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles|accessdate=14 September 2015|isbn=9780959362657|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The name of Achilles has been used for at least nine Royal Navy warships since 1744 – both as [[HMS Achilles|HMS ''Achilles'']] and with the French spelling [[HMS Achille|HMS ''Achille'']]. A 60-gun ship of that name served at the Battle of Belleisle in 1761 while a 74-gun ship served at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Other battle honours include Walcheren 1809. An armored cruiser of that name served in the Royal Navy during the First World War.

After returning to the [[Royal Navy]], the ship was sold to the [[Indian Navy]] in 1948 but when she was scrapped parts of the ship were saved and preserved in New Zealand.

Born in [[Kentucky]], Lincoln grew up on the [[American frontier|frontier]] in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. He became a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader [[Stephen A. Douglas]] in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 Illinois Senate campaign]]. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] and winning. Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the [[constitutional right]]s of Southern states to practice slavery. They began the process of [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; [[War Democrats]], who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall1947&quot; /&gt;{{rp|65–87}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became an iconic call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. A few days after the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]], he was shot by [[John Wilkes Booth]], an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero.

==Family and childhood==
===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, as the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a one-room log cabin on [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|20–22}} He was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from [[Hingham, Norfolk]], to its namesake, [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's westward migration, passing through [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|3,4}}&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|20}} Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Captain Abraham Lincoln]], moved the family from Virginia to [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]], in the 1780s.&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|4}} Captain Lincoln was killed in an [[Northwest Indian War|Indian raid]] in 1786.

[[File:Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.jpg|thumb|left|Replica of Lincoln's birthplace near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].]]
Lincoln's mother, Nancy, is widely assumed to have been the daughter of Lucy Hanks, although no record documents this.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|79}} Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|9}} They produced three children: [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]], born on February 10, 1807; Abraham, on February 12, 1809; and Thomas, who died in infancy.&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

Thomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky. Thomas became embroiled in legal disputes, and lost all but {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of his land in court disputes over [[Title (property)|property titles]].&lt;ref name=Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|20}} In 1816, the family moved to [[Indiana]], where the survey process was more reliable and land titles were more secure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13}} Indiana was a &quot;free&quot; (non-slaveholding) territory, and they settled in an &quot;unbroken forest&quot;&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|26}} in Hurricane Township, [[History of Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]]. (Their land became part of [[Spencer County, Indiana]], when the county was established in 1818.)&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|16 and 43}}&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|3, 5, 16}} In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot;, but mainly due to land title difficulties.&lt;ref name=Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|20}}&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|23–24}}

In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|34, 156}} He owned farms, town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. Thomas and Nancy were members of a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|22–24}}

Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas eventually obtained clear title to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} of land in what became known as the [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]].&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|24, 104}}

===Mother's death===
On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died of [[milk sickness]], leaving 11-year-old [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]] in charge of a household that included her father, 9-year-old Abraham, and Dennis Hanks, Nancy's 19-year-old orphaned cousin.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|22–23, 77}} Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a [[stillborn]] son. Lincoln was very distraught over his sister's death.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|20, 30–33}}&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|37}}

On December 2, 1819, Thomas married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Bush Johnston]], a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|23, 83}} Abraham became close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as &quot;Mother&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|26–27}}&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|10}} Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. He was called lazy for all his &quot;reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.&quot;.&lt;ref name= Miller/&gt;{{rp|31}}&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|25, 31, and 47}}&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|33}} His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy &quot;physical labor&quot;, but loved to read.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|66}}

===Education===
Lincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling (from travelling teachers) was intermittent, totaling less than 12 months; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|10, 33}}&lt;ref name=Madison/&gt;{{rp|110}} Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that he read and reread the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], [[Aesop's Fables]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', [[Mason Locke Weems]]'s ''The Life of Washington'', and ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]'', among others.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|29–31, 38–43}}

Teenaged Lincoln took responsibility for chores. He accepted the customary practice that a son give his father all earnings from work outside the home until age 21.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|30–33}} Lincoln became adept at using an axe. Tall for his age, Lincoln was strong and athletic.&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|134–35}} He became known for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as &quot;the Clary's Grove boys&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|41}}

===Illinois===
In early March 1830, partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|36}} Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to do so. One possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, might not have matched Thomas's stability and steady income.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|38–40}}

After the family relocated to Illinois, Abraham became increasingly distant from Thomas,&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|71}} in part because of his father's lack of education, although occasionally lending him money.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|28 and 152}} In 1831, as Thomas and other family prepared to move to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], Abraham left home.&lt;ref name=Oates1994/&gt;{{rp|15–17}} He lived in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem]] for six years.&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|23–53}} Lincoln and some friends took goods by [[flatboat]] to New Orleans, where he witnessed slavery firsthand.&lt;ref name= Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|22–23}}&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|38}}

According to some sources, Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gannett |first=Lewis |date=Winter 2005 |title=&quot;Overwhelming Evidence&quot; of a Lincoln-Ann Rutledge Romance?: Reexamining Rutledge Family Reminiscences |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |magazine=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |location=Springfield, IL |publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association |pages=28–41 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014805/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |archivedate=April 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|55–58}} In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|67–69}}&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|56–57, 69–70}}

Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Owens a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|67}}

In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], a daughter of [[Robert Smith Todd]], a wealthy slave-owner in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name= Lamb/&gt;{{rp|3}} They met in [[Springfield, Illinois]] in December 1839&lt;ref name= Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|46–48}} and were engaged a year later.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|86}} A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled at Lincoln's initiative.&lt;ref name= Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|46–48}}&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|87}} They reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister.&lt;ref name= Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|50–51}} While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, Lincoln was asked where he was going and replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|93}} In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant.&lt;ref name= Baker/&gt;{{rp|142}}

He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in 1843 and [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie) in 1846. Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis. [[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|179–181, 476}} Robert reached adulthood and produced children.

Herndon]] would grow irritated when Lincoln would bring his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his own work to notice his children's behaviour. Herndon recounted, &quot;I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut. Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hertz |first1=Emanuel |title=The Hidden Lincoln |date=1938 |publisher=The Viking Press |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Abraham suffered from &quot;[[history of depression|melancholy]]&quot;, a condition later referred to as [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanticoct2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression |title=Lincoln's Great Depression |first=Joshua Wolf |last=Shenk |date=October 2005 |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044732/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincoln-apos-s-great-depression/4247/ |archivedate=October 9, 2011 |url-status=live  |access-date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.&lt;ref name= Steers/&gt;{{rp|341}}

Mary cooked for Lincoln often during his presidency.

==Early career and militia service==

In 1832, Lincoln and partner [[Denton Offutt]] bought a general store on credit in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth J.

That March he entered politics, running for the [[Illinois General Assembly]], advocating navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He could draw crowds as a [[raconteur]], but he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money and lost the election.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|41}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hN7QQgAACAAJ}}|title=Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln Volume 3 |chapter=The Improvement of Sangamon River|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|editor-first=Marion Mills |editor-last=Miller |year=1832|publisher=Wildside Press|isbn=9781434424976|language=en}} [[s:Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln/Volume 3/The Improvement of Sangamon River|WP article]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln interrupted his campaign to briefly serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia (during the [[Black Hawk War]]).&lt;ref name= Winkle/&gt;{{rp|86–95}} He then returned to his campaign. At his first speech, he observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his &quot;neck and the seat of his trousers&quot; and tossed him.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|46}} Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.&lt;ref name= Winkle/&gt;{{rp|114–116}}

Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: &quot;I studied with nobody&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|53–55}}

== Illinois state legislature ==

His second state legislature campaign in 1834 was successful. Although he ran as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|59}} Lincoln served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a Whig from Sangamon County.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot; /&gt;{{rp|283}} He supported the construction of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], later serving as a Canal Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/abraham-lincoln-in-depth/abraham-lincoln-and-internal-improvements/#imc|title=Abraham Lincoln and Internal Improvements|last=Weik|first=Jesse William|work=Abraham Lincoln's Classroom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212045823/http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/abraham-lincoln-in-depth/abraham-lincoln-and-internal-improvements/#imc|archivedate=February 12, 2015|url-status=live|access-date=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot; /&gt;{{rp|130}} He was known for his &quot;free soil&quot; stance of opposing both slavery and [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, &quot;[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald1996&quot; /&gt;{{rp|134}} He followed [[Henry Clay]] in supporting the [[American Colonization Society]] program of advocating abolition and helping freed slaves to settle in [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|17–19, 67}}

From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be &quot;an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|222}} The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] including railroads, and urbanization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boritt2002&quot;/&gt;{{rp|137–153}}

Lincoln ran for the Whig nomination for Illinois's 7th district of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1843, but was defeated by [[John J. Hardin]]. However, Lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby Hardin would retire after only one term. Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|123–124}} Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, showing party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.&lt;ref name=Oates1974/&gt;{{rp|79}} Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman [[Joshua R. Giddings]], wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the [[Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter.

Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidler2006&quot; /&gt;{{rp|181–183}} Lincoln supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which if passed would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.house.gov/Records-and-Research/Listing/lfp_037/|title=Lincoln's Spot Resolution {{!}}|publisher=US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|language=en|access-date=February 13, 2019|date=December 22, 1847|work=National Archives Building, RG 233, Entry 362: Thirtieth Congress, 1847–1849, Records of Legislative Proceedings, Bills and Resolutions Originating in the House, 1847–1849|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213123646/https://history.house.gov/Records-and-Research/Listing/lfp_037/|archive-date=February 13, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holzer&quot; /&gt;{{rp|63}}

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oates1974&quot; /&gt;{{rp|79–80}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|199–202}} Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|199–202}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerleman&quot; /&gt;{{rp|40}}

Congress neither debated nor enacted the resolution, the national papers ignored it, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovern&quot; /&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|202}}&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerSchamel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/ |title=Lincoln's Spot Resolutions |publisher=National Archives |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920053345/http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/ |archivedate=September 20, 2011 |url-status=dead  |access-date=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald1996&quot; /&gt;{{rp|128}}

Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|124–126}} Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the [[General Land Office]], but lost out.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|140}} The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the [[Oregon Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Isaac Newton |date=1885 |title=The Life of Abraham Lincoln |volume=2 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ|page=81}} |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Janses, McClurg, &amp; Company |page=81 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403025741/https://books.google.com/books?id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ |archivedate=April 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.&lt;ref name= Harris/&gt;{{rp|55–57}}

In 1851, he represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with shareholder James A.

The decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] was cited by many other courts.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|155}} Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor.&lt;ref name= Handy/&gt;{{rp|440}} From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|155–156, 196–197}} Lincoln's legal reputation gave rise to his nickname &quot;Honest Abe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5GJ6Un1JA_8C}}|title=The Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln|last=Library|first=Philosophical|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1-4532-0281-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|150–151}} The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|150–151}}

Lincoln rarely raised objections; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of killing a man, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|150–151}}&lt;ref name= Harrison1935&gt;{{cite book|oclc=3512772|last=Harrison|first=J.

===Emergence as Republican leader===
{{Further|Slave states and free states|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln in 1858, the year of [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|his debates]] with [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] over slavery.]]

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North. The [[Compromise of 1850]] failed to defuse the issue.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|175–176}} In the early 1850s, Lincoln supported sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for Clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to &quot;both extremes&quot; on the slavery issue.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|182–185}} As the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]] became particularly acrimonious, and Senator Douglas proposed [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise measure; the proposal would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The proposal alarmed many Northerners, who hoped to prevent the spread of slavery into the territories. Despite this Northern opposition, Douglas's [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|188–190}}

For months after its passage, Lincoln did not publicly comment, but he came to strongly oppose it.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|196–197}} On October 16, 1854, in his &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]&quot;, Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|148–152}} Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a powerful voice,&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|199}} he said the Kansas Act had a &quot;''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=Basler/&gt;{{rp|255}} Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|203–205}}

Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|215–216}} Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and antislavery [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members, the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery.&lt;ref name= McGovern/&gt;{{rp|38–39}} Lincoln resisted early recruiting attempts, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|203–204}} Lincoln hoped to rejuvenate the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[Know Nothing]] movement.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|191–194}}

In the 1854 elections, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|203–205}} In the elections' aftermath, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Lincoln instead sought election to the United States Senate.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|204–205}} At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.&lt;ref name=Oates1974/&gt;{{rp|119}} After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]]. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|205–208}}

==== 1856 campaign ====
In part due to the ongoing [[Bleeding Kansas|violent political confrontations in Kansas]], opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the [[United States elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 [[Bloomington Convention]], which formally established the [[Illinois Republican Party]]. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|216–221}} At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], Lincoln received significant support to run for vice president, though the party nominated [[William Dayton]] to run with [[John C. Frémont]]. Lincoln supported the Republican ticket, campaigning throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador [[James Buchanan]], who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the slavery debate, while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|224–228}} Buchanan defeated both his challengers. Republican [[William Henry Bissell]] won election as Governor of Illinois. Lincoln's vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|229–230}}

==== Principles ====
[[File:DredScott.jpg|alt=Painting|thumb|upright|A portrait of [[Dred Scott]]. Lincoln denounced the Supreme Court decision in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery.]]

[[Eric Foner]] (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name=Foner2010/&gt;{{rp|84–88}}

==== ''Dred Scott'' ====
In March 1857, in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]],'' Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|236–238}} Lincoln denounced it, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zarefsky&quot; /&gt;{{rp|69–110}} Lincoln argued, &quot;The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffa&quot; /&gt;{{rp|299–300}}

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
{{Further|Lincoln–Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}

Douglas was up for re-election in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican senator, many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|247–248}} Some eastern Republicans favored Douglas's re-election in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]].&lt;ref name=Oates1974/&gt;{{rp|138–139}} Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|247–250}}
[[File:Lincoln O-17 by Brady, 1860.png|thumb|left|Abraham Lincoln (1860) by [[Mathew Brady]], taken the day of the Cooper Union speech.]]
Accepting the nomination, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], drawing on {{Bibleverse|Mark |3:25}}, &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|251}} The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion.&lt;ref name= Harris/&gt;{{rp|98}} The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|209}} When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, &quot;[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&amp;nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.&quot;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|257–258}}

The Senate campaign featured seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|debates]], the most famous political debates in American history.&lt;ref name=McPherson1993/&gt;{{rp|182}} The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that [[all men are created equal]], while Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|214–224}} The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln's argument was rooted in morality. He claimed that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas's argument was legal, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the ''Dred Scott'' decision.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|223}}

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. Lincoln's articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence.&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|89–90}} In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'', a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|242, 412}} In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by [[William H. Seward]], [[Salmon P. Chase]], [[Edward Bates]], and [[Simon Cameron]]. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure whether to seek the office.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|291–293}} In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|307–308}}

On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the [[List of national founders|Founding Fathers]] had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted that morality required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jaffa/&gt;{{rp|473}} Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly&lt;ref name=Holzer/&gt;{{rp|108–111}}—Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.&quot;&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref name=Holzer/&gt;{{rp|157}}

Historian [[David Herbert Donald]] described the speech as a &quot;superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|240}} In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|241}}

On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|244}} Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], [[Norman B.

On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]]. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the tariff.&lt;ref name=Luthin/&gt;{{rp|609–629}}

Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by Pennsylvania iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support.&lt;ref name=Hofstadter/&gt;{{rp|50–55}} Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation, while following Lincoln's dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that bind me&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|247–250}}

Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boritt2002&quot;/&gt;{{rp|10, 13, 18}} Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]], disagreeing with Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected incumbent Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|253}} A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] and nominated [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{Rp|247–248}}

Lincoln's campaign team carefully projected his image as an ideal candidate. Michael Martinez wrote:

{{quote|Lincoln and his political advisers manipulated his image and background....Sometimes he appeared as a straight-shooting, plain-talking, common-sense-wielding man of the people. His image as the &quot;Rail Splitter&quot; dates from this era. His supporters also portrayed him as &quot;Honest Abe,&quot; the country fellow who was simply dressed and not especially polished or formal in his manner but who was as honest and trustworthy as his legs were long. Even Lincoln's tall, gangly frame was used to good advantage during the campaign as many drawings and posters show the candidates sprinting past his vertically challenged rivals. At other times, Lincoln appeared as a sophisticated, thoughtful, articulate, &quot;presidential&quot; candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the [[Wide Awakes]], which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.&lt;ref name=Audacious&gt;{{cite book|title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming|last=Chadwick|first=Bruce|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=2PQqZzyw4uAC|page=l49}}|pages=147–149|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Illinois|date=2009|accessdate=April 1, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402091121/https://books.google.com/books?id=2PQqZzyw4uAC&amp;pgpage=149|archivedate=April 2, 2017|isbn=978-1-4022-4756-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's ideas of abolishing [[slavery]] grew, drawing more supporters.

As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln was the only one to give no speeches. Instead, he relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Thousands of Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of &quot;free labor&quot;, whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|254–256}} The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000–200,000 copies.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|254}}
